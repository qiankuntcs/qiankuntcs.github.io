I am a research associate professor at School of Cyber Science and Engineering of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Before joining HUST, I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), under [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/) in 2021. Before that I got my B.E. from Chu Kochen Honors College under [Guochuan Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/gczhang) at Zhejiang University (ZJU) in 2017.

I was the recipient of Wuhan Young Talent, East Lake Young Talent in HUST, Lee Shau Kee Postgraduate Fellowships and Y S & Christabel Lung Postgraduate Scholarship in HKU, and Dean's Scholarship in ZJU.

My research broadly focuses on:

* Theoretical computer science: particularly focusing on designing online algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Recently, I am also interested in AI-assisted online optimization;
* Trustworthy ML: particularly focusing on explainability, fairness and privacy of ML techniques.

I regularly have 2-3 positions for M.S. students. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email with your CV. Undergraduate research interns are also welcome.
